			  "content":"Over the course of my senior year of high school, I worked on my most ambitious implementation of Boxman I had ever undertaken. The goal for this version was to imagine what Boxman would be like of it originated in the early 1980s as its own arcade machine. \n\nI used a Super Pac-Man cabinet as the shell which I sanded and painted a nice Boxman-blue. Then I found some software I could run on the computer I put inside the cabinet that would allow it to use the original Super Pac-Man CRT as a monitor. After that it was a matter of drawing up graphics for the bezel, the control panel, and the marquee, getting those made at various sign shops, and actually writing the game to run. \n\nI finished the project 3 days before my grad party where it made its debut. It was a hit! The following winter I worked with the local arcade and got it placed there where it stood among real arcade machines for 6 months. It was pretty surreal seeing it adjacent to Super Mario Bros. and noticing how it blended right in. \n\nI consider this project a huge success and it was very fun to build!",

          "content":"In summer of 2021 I designed and built a physical programmer calculator. \n\nIt is a custom PCB surrounded by a 3D printed ABS case with 3D printed buttons (don't even ask how many button iterations I went through) each with a drawn-on label. The screen is 16 7-segment displays, 8 for the top row and 8 for the bottom row to display 2 32 bit numbers, and 64 individual red LEDs to display the binary representation of the same 2 32 bit numbers. The brain is an ATMEGA 128 because I wanted the extra IO for the button matrix and keypad LEDs.\n\nIt can display and receive numbers in decimal, binary, and hex, as well as doing all the necessary integer operations and bitwise operations. The calculator operates using Reverse Polish Notation. The two numbers displayed are the two top numbers on the stack (the bottom number is the top of the stack.) Single operand operations such as bit shifting, 2^x, 1's and 2's compliment are done on the number on the top of the stack.\n\nIt measures 3.05\" x 4.7\" x 0.6\". I heavily based its looks off of old Commodore calculators with red LED screens and colorful buttons.\n\nThis was a fun project to build, and has come in handy more than a few times for me.",

We built the seat out of 3/16\" plywood, upholstery foam, and faux leather.\n\nFrom the few times we've driven it around, it has held up very well!
